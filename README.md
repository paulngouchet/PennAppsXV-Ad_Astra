# PennAppsXV-Ad_Astra
Mood Tracker built using IOS Swift During PennApps Hackathon.

With my team we built an IOS Application using Swift that can help a therapist track the mood of a child every week. It is built using 
advanced UX/UI features resembling a game allowing the child to feel confident when interacting with it every day to log in his current mood.
